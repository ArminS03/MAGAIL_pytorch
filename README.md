# Multi-Agent Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of the Multi-Agent Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) algorithm,
originally implemented in TensorFlow version 1. The code in this repository is a conversion of the codebase from TensorFlow v1 to PyTorch, making it more accessible and compatible for research porpuses.
